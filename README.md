# Kobe: Life, Death, & Resurrection
-------------------------------------
## Data Project Assignment 1
-------------------------------------



### What you aimed to accomplish
- A couple of graphs with a clear delivery
- A website that doesn't look like it's falling apart

### Short description of your findings
The name “Kobe” is legendary, but it was barely a blip among new parents in 1996 when Kobe Bryant entered the NBA. Bryant’s meteoric rise began with his All-Star debut in 1998, and he quickly reached superstar status with 3 straight NBA championships from 2000-2002. This led to a new “handle” for many new baby boys. Upon Kobe’s tragic death in an accident in January 2020, the name spiked again, rising 300% for both boys *and* girls.


### Sources for my data
|Social Security Administration|https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html|
I used the dataset provided for other assignment for storytelling class.


### Overview of the data analysis process
The raw dataset was quite simple, consisting of years, names, sexes and states. Searching for an insightful story out of a mass of baby names, I discovered the name "Kobe" has an interesting curve over the years and started from there. I extracted data that meets both Name that equals to Kobe and group them by states and sexes using pandas in Python.


### A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project
1. Skills I learned
- How to build a website and a basic CSS to decorate my website not to look poor
- How to structure raw data that suits the subject
- What data is required to make a 3D animated point map

2. Where I grew the most during the project
- When I finished the project in spite of inevitable frustration


### A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)
1. My first idea was about this question that has wandered in my head for years: "Is Jazz dying?" I really wanted to take this subject further but Spotify API has a lot more complicated structure than what I previously learned from class. I asked for help from TAs and a professor but had to change the subject due to a lack of time. Though I hope I can comeback to this idea, types of data by Spotify API acutally seems very vague and personal-use oriented, so I'm not very sure if I could.
2. I used both Datawrapper and Flourish for making graph and the latter gave me a hard time. Flourish offered a variety of detailed maps with fascinating features such an animation. But it was as hard to crack at first as complexity that maps contain, and I actually have not figure out how I can extend the y aix of the timeline of the 3d animated point map. I'd like to figure it out soon.
3. My 1st project github webpage has a simple facade right now. I'd love to learn more aboout CSS and HTML, making it fancier.
